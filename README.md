Python-Thermal-Printer
======================
My tweaks to Adafruit's raspberry pi thermal printer code.

Here's the original: https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer 

What I've changed:
 - main.py no longer pollls Twitter
 - removed button code from main.py
 - removed the function from main.py that prints the IP adress
 - added testCodeHere.py to test individual features
